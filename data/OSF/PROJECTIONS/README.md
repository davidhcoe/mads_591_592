No data is natively housed within this folder. In order to generate data, please run the scripts located in the `SCRIPTS` folder. After scripts are run, this folder will be populated with the following datasets:

`/EVAL/` - contains county-level population projections for each of the 50 states for the period 2000-2015 for use in the out-of-sample validation. There are 50 (one for each state) CSVs.

`/PROJECTIONS/` - contains county-level population projections for each of the 50 states for the period 2015-2100. There are 50 (one for each state) CSVs. **These data are not controlled to the SSPs and are not for actual use.**
